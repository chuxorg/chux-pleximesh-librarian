# AWACS Mission Rail — Scaling & Grouping Rules

## Purpose

Prevent clutter as mission modes increase while preserving cockpit awareness.

---

## Rules

1. Flat Deck (Baseline)

   - Recommended up to a small, manageable set of missions

2. Grouped Decks

   - Missions grouped by operational domain
   - Group selection must remain explicit and glanceable

3. No Hidden State
   - Active mission deck is always visible
   - No implicit context switching

---

## Non-Goals

- Unlimited flat lists
- Search-only discovery
- Workspace metaphors

---

## Charter Alignment

- UI-first (§3)
- Cockpit mentality (§4.1)
- Extensibility (§6)
