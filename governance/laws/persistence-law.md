# Persistence Law — Artifact & Prompt Centralization

## Status

Constitutional Law  
Enforced by Guardian  
Effective Immediately

---

## Purpose

This law establishes **mandatory persistence** for all agent activity.

The Librarian is the **sole system of record** for:

- Prompts
- Artifacts
- Decisions
- Reviews
- Results

If an artifact is not persisted, it does not exist.

---

## Scope

This law applies to:

- All agents (UI, Guardian, PM, Engineer, QA, Documentation, future agents)
- All prompts handed to agents
- All outputs generated by agents
- All reviews, approvals, blocks, or escalations

No exceptions.

---

## Hard Rule

**Every prompt given to an agent and every artifact produced by an agent MUST be persisted to the Librarian.**

This includes:

- Prompts issued by humans
- Prompts issued by other agents
- Intermediate artifacts
- Final artifacts
- Reviews and decisions

Chat memory, inference, or conversational context are not valid substitutes.

---

## Operational Model (Current Release)

Agents are responsible for ensuring persistence by:

- Explicitly emitting artifacts
- Declaring destination paths
- Blocking progress if persistence fails

An agent task is **incomplete** until artifacts are persisted.

---

## Future Model (Event-Driven)

In a future release:

- Agents will emit events only (not manage persistence)
- Example events:
  - `prompt.received`
  - `artifact.generated`
  - `decision.issued`
- Event payloads will include full content
- The Librarian will:
  - Subscribe to events
  - Classify artifacts
  - Determine canonical storage paths
  - Persist automatically

This law remains in force regardless of implementation model.

---

## Guardian Enforcement

The Guardian MUST:

- BLOCK any action that references a non-persisted artifact
- Reject silent approvals
- Reject inferred or remembered artifacts
- Require explicit Librarian paths for all reviews

The only valid Guardian response to a missing artifact is:
**BLOCK — artifact not persisted**

---

## Guiding Principle

Persistence is not overhead.  
Persistence is how agents communicate, cooperate, and remain auditable.

If it is not in the Librarian, it did not happen.
