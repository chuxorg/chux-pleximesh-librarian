title: Artifact Ingestion Is Not the Librarian API

decision: >
  Artifact creation and storage must not occur through the Librarian runtime API.
  The Librarian runtime API is permanently read-only and serves only as a
  truth-retrieval surface. All artifact creation occurs through a separate
  ingestion mechanism.

rationale:
  - Preserves immutability guarantees
  - Prevents authority and accessibility conflation
  - Maintains auditability and phase governance

policy:
  - Agents never write to the Librarian runtime API
  - Agents submit artifacts for ingestion
  - Ingestion assigns artifact_id and registers inventory
  - Librarian runtime API exposes GET-only access

standardized_language:
  allowed:
    - "Submit for ingestion"
  forbidden:
    - "POST to Librarian"
    - "Write to the Library"
    - "Store via API"

scope:
  - Applies to all artifacts
  - Applies to all agents
  - Applies regardless of authentication or deployment context

consequences:
  - No changes to Librarian runtime API
  - No tooling introduced by this decision
  - Ingestion is a required governance step for phase closure
