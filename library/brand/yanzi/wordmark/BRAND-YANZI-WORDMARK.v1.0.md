# YANZI WORDMARK — FINAL SPEC

## Status
Locked. Approved for production use.

## Scope
Primary brand wordmark for Yanzi.
No symbols. No monogram. Wordmark-only identity.

---

## 1. Wordmark

**Text**
- `yanzi` (all lowercase)

**Typeface Characteristics**
- Modern sans serif
- Neutral proportions
- Low contrast
- No decorative terminals
- Slight forward lean (≈ 6–8°) to imply motion
- No ligatures

The wordmark must feel inevitable and professional, not expressive or trendy.

---

## 2. Underline (Motion Indicator)

The underline is structural, not decorative.

### Geometry
- Single continuous stroke
- Uniform thickness
- No tapering
- No calligraphic variation

### Stroke Weight
- Approximately 70–80% of the primary stem weight of the wordmark

### Curvature
- Near-linear
- Very shallow arc
- Total vertical rise (start to end) ≤ 15% of the wordmark x-height

### Direction
- Begins slightly lower under the `y`
- Ends slightly higher under the `i`
- No exaggerated central curvature

### Ends
- Clean cut or minimal radius matching the wordmark’s terminal radius
- No pointed or swoosh-like ends

### Alignment
- Horizontally centered under the wordmark
- Vertical gap between text and underline ≈ 0.35–0.45 × x-height

If the underline appears almost straight at first glance, it is correct.

## 3. Color

**Primary**
- Monochrome only
  - Black on light backgrounds
  - White on dark backgrounds

**Rules**
- Underline always inherits the wordmark color
- No gradients
- No outlines

- No embedded brand color

Color is owned by the product UI, not the logo.

---

## 5. Scaling & Legibility

**Minimum Sizes**
- Digital: 24px height
- Print: 10mm height

At very small sizes:
- Underline may visually flatten
- Wordmark legibility takes precedence

---

## 6. Lockups

**Primary Lockup**
- Wordmark with underline only

No alternate lockups.
No standalone symbol.
No monogram.

If an icon is required (favicon, app icon):
- Use the wordmark alone
- Centered
- Underline may be omitted below ~16px if clarity suffers

---

## 7. Implementation Notes

- Deliver as vector (SVG)
- All strokes expanded to outlines
- Clean paths only
- Pixel-fit underline at common UI sizes (24, 32, 48)

---

## 8. Brand Intent (Invariant)

This identity must always communicate:
- Calm authority
- Experience
- Technical credibility
- Motion without urgency
- Confidence without noise

Any future change that increases loudness, trendiness, or overt “AI” signaling is considered a regression.
