title: Artifact Ingestion Tooling Deferred

statement: >
  No tooling is introduced at this time for artifact ingestion.
  There will be no CLI, service, API, or code changes related to ingestion.
  This decision intentionally limits scope to clarity, naming, and governance
  until a future phase explicitly authorizes tooling work.

scope:
  - Applies to all ingestion-related work
  - Applies to all agents and phases

constraints:
  - Librarian runtime API remains read-only
  - Ingestion continues via existing LIB-003 mechanisms

related_artifacts:
  - ADR_INGESTION_NOT_LIBRARY_API.v1
  - POLICY_AGENT_LANGUAGE_INGESTION.v1
