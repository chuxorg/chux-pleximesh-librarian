title: Standardized Agent Language for Artifact Ingestion

purpose: >
  To eliminate ambiguity between artifact ingestion and the Librarian runtime API
  by enforcing precise, mandatory language in all agent interactions.

normative_rules:
  required_language:
    - "Submit for ingestion"
    - "Ingest via LIB-003"
  prohibited_language:
    - "POST to Librarian"
    - "Write to the Library"
    - "Store via API"
    - "Persist through Librarian endpoint"

enforcement:
  - Mandatory in all agent prompts
  - Mandatory in execution phases
  - Mandatory in documentation and ADRs

scope:
  - Applies to all agents
  - Applies to all artifact kinds
  - Applies across all phases

rationale:
  - Prevents conflation of authority and accessibility
  - Aligns human and agent mental models
  - Preserves Librarian immutability
