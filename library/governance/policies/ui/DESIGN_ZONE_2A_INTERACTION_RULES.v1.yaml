title: Zone 2a Domain Navigation Interaction Rules

purpose: >
  To define strict interaction rules for Zone 2a (Left Toolbar Rail),
  ensuring predictable, canonical domain navigation without execution risk
  or contextual ambiguity.

zone_definition:
  zone: 2a
  name: Left Toolbar Rail
  role: Domain navigation (primary)

interaction_rules:
  click_behavior:
    - Selecting a domain switches the entire main workspace context
    - Domain selection is immediate and deterministic
    - No confirmation dialogs are required for navigation

selection_state:
    - Exactly one domain is active at all times
    - Active domain state is persistent across sessions
    - Active state is visually distinct and unambiguous

scope_constraints:
  allowed:
    - Domain switching (Home, Library, Projects, Workflows, Agents, Teams)
  prohibited:
    - Workspace-specific actions
    - Execution or run controls
    - Per-artifact tools
    - Contextual actions dependent on active view
    - Dynamic insertion, hiding, or reordering of domains

structure_rules:
  - Domains are fixed and canonical
  - Order is system-defined and immutable
  - Icons and labels are always visible
  - No nested menus or sub-navigation

extension_policy:
  allowed_extensions:
    - Cross-domain lenses (e.g. Activity, Audit)
  extension_constraints:
    - Must apply across multiple domains
    - Must not alter execution state
    - Must be visually distinguished from core domains
    - Must be few in number

accessibility_rules:
  - Domain identity must not rely on color alone
  - Icons and labels must be readable at all times
  - Hover may reinforce meaning but must not reveal hidden actions

non_goals:
  - Zone 2a is not a customization surface
  - Zone 2a does not expose power-user shortcuts
  - Zone 2a does not reflect workspace or phase state
