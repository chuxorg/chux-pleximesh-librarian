summary:
  - Canonical UI shell installed (UI_SHELL_YANZI.v3)
  - Legacy UI logic rebound into canonical zones
  - No geometry, layout, or visual changes introduced
  - Renderer uses DOM scaffolding to re-home legacy IDs
  - UI verified manually in Electron runtime

locked_artifacts:
  - UI_SHELL_YANZI.v3
  - UI_ZONES_YANZI.v1
  - UI_ARCH_DECISION_SHELL_REPLACEMENT.v1
  - PHASE_COMPLETION_CONTRACT.v1
  - PHASE_BRANCH_HYGIENE.v1

execution_details:
  renderer:
    file: renderer.js
    behavior:
      - creates DOM scaffolding aligned to canonical zones
      - rebinds legacy element IDs into zone containers
      - preserves legacy UI logic and event handling
      - performs no geometry or layout mutation
      - introduces no new UI elements
  index:
    file: index.html
    behavior:
      - loads canonical UI shell
      - loads renderer.js
      - does not include legacy layout HTML

constraints:
  librarian_access:
    mode: read-only
    enforced_by: ui contract tests
    write_endpoints: false
    authentication: none

verification:
  automated:
    - ui contract tests enforcing GET-only behavior passing
    - build succeeds
  manual:
    - Electron runtime launched successfully
    - UI elements visually constrained to canonical zones
    - No unexpected visuals or interactions observed

notes:
  - Phase 2 work was structural rebinding only
  - No redesign or intentional UI changes were performed
  - All changes comply with locked shell and zone artifacts
