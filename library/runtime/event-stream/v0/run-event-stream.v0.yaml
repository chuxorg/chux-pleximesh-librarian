  type: runtime.event_stream
  version: v0
  status: ACTIVE
  authority: system

principles:
  - All events MUST be associated with a run_id
  - Events without a valid run_id are invalid
  - System events define execution truth
  - Event ordering must be deterministic per run

correlation:
  required_fields:
    - run_id
    - event.type
    - event.timestamp
    - event.version

ordering:
  guarantees:
    - run.started MUST be the first event in a run
    - run.completed OR run.aborted MUST be the final event
    - Events MUST be ordered by timestamp within a run
    - System events take precedence over mission events when simultaneous

event_classes:
  system:
    delivery: guaranteed
    persistence: required
    consumers:
      - guardian

  agent:
    delivery: best_effort

    must_reject_events_outside_run_bounds: true

  awacs:

    must_highlight_terminal_event: true

replay:
  supported: true
  requirements:
    - complete event history
    - immutable events
    - preserved ordering
