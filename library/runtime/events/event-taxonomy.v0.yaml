  type: event.taxonomy
  version: v0
  status: ACTIVE
  authority: system

principles:
  - System events describe ground truth and MUST always be emitted
  - Mission events describe responses or side effects to events
  - Missions may subscribe to system events but may not suppress them
  - AWACS and Guardian must always receive system events

event_classes:

  system_events:
    description: >
      Fixed, mandatory events required for governance, auditability,
      escalation, and human authority. These events are immutable and
      cannot be disabled, renamed, intercepted, or overridden.

    immutability_rules:
      can_disable: false
      can_rename: false
      can_modify_payload: false
      can_suppress_delivery: false
      visible_to:
        - guardian
        - awacs
        - human

    events:
      - guardian.requirements.pass
      - guardian.requirements.revise
      - guardian.requirements.reject

      - guardian.decision.recorded

      - pm.plan.created
      - pm.plan.approved

      - engineer.started
      - engineer.completed

      - qa.verification.passed
      - qa.verification.failed

      - system.blocked
      - system.escalation.required

  mission_events:
    description: >
      Configurable events that may be enabled, disabled, added, or
      bound by a Mission. Mission events may react to system events
      but may not interfere with their emission or storage.

    mutability_rules:
      can_enable_disable: true
      can_add_custom: true
      can_bind_to_system_events: true
      can_trigger_side_effects: true
      can_block_system_events: false

    examples:
      - notify.sms
      - notify.email
      - notify.slack
      - human.input.requested
      - human.approval.requested
      - custom.audit.snapshot
      - custom.metrics.emit

binding_rules:
  - Missions may bind mission events to:
      - agent lifecycle hooks
      - system events
  - Missions may not bind actions that suppress, delay, or replace
    system events
  - Multiple mission events may subscribe to the same system event

enforcement:
  guardian:
    must_enforce_immutability: true
    must_escalate_on_violation: true

  awacs:
    must_display_all_system_events: true
    must_display_mission_events_when_enabled: true

audit:
  immutable: true
