  name: MVP Contract Lock

mode: advisory

summary:
  intent: >
    Lock the minimal contracts required for MVP safety, determinism, auditability, and replay.
  scope_in:
    - Run lifecycle (CREATED/STARTED/PAUSED/COMPLETED/ABORTED)
    - System lifecycle events (system.run.*)
    - Event envelope requirements (event_id, timestamp, type, schema_version, run_id, emitter, sequence, trace_id, parent_event_id)
    - Guardian decision model (PASS|REVISE|REJECT)
    - Abort semantics (system.run.aborted only)
    - MVP required event set
  scope_out:
    - Multi-mission orchestration
    - Dynamic replanning
    - Concurrency and nested runs
    - Enforcement implementation (Phase 1)

decisions:
  - id: DEC-LIFECYCLE-1
    description: Canonical run lifecycle states and transitions locked for MVP.
    rationale: Determinism and replay-safe execution truth.

  - id: DEC-ENVELOPE-1
    description: Canonical event envelope locked for MVP; sequence is required ordering key.
    rationale: Eliminates timestamp-tie ambiguity; enables deterministic replay.

  - id: DEC-GUARDIAN-1
    description: Guardian outcomes are PASS|REVISE|REJECT; decisions are explicit events.
    rationale: Prevents implicit approvals; makes gating auditable.

  - id: DEC-ABORT-1
    description: ABORTED is represented only by system.run.aborted; completed cannot encode aborted.
    rationale: Removes semantic drift and ambiguity.

  - id: DEC-TAXONOMY-1
    description: MVP required vs optional event types are defined.
    rationale: Prevents event soup; ensures minimum audit trail.

risks:
  - id: RISK-PLACEHOLDERS-1
    description: Placeholder charters/templates may under-constrain agent behavior during MVP.
    mitigation: Phase 1 gateway enforcement + Phase 2 minimal charters/templates; post-MVP QA audit.
