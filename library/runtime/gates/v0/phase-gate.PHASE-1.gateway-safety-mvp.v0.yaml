  id: PHASE-1
  name: Gateway Safety MVP

mode: advisory

summary:
  intent: >
    Enforce Phase 0 contracts in runtime: envelope validation, deterministic ordering, lifecycle truth,
    terminal behavior, and guardian gating.
  scope_in:
    - Runtime event gateway enforcing envelope + schema_version + sequence + lifecycle + terminal rules
    - Guardian gating enforced at runtime ingress (PASS allow, REVISE block, REJECT abort with evidence)
    - MISSION-DEFAULT-SDLC wired to emit MVP-required events and obey gates
    - Repo-wide tests passing
  scope_out:
    - CI automation (manual enforcement accepted)
    - Rehydration tooling
    - QA agent (post-MVP)

decisions:
  - id: DEC-PH1-1
    description: Phase 1 completed as advisory gate; workflow remains lightweight/manual for now.
    rationale: Maintain momentum while preserving drift control via phase artifacts and tests.
