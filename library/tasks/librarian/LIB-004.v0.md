# LIB-004 — Librarian REST API OpenAPI Specification

## Status
Planned

## Objective

Produce and maintain a **canonical OpenAPI 3.1 specification** for the Librarian REST API.

This spec is the contract for:
- agents
- demos
- Postman collections
- future UI consumers

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- OpenAPI 3.1 YAML
- Read-only endpoints
- Schema definitions
- Error models
- Versioning rules

### Out of Scope

- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Write APIs (beyond import)

---

## Requirements

- OpenAPI file stored under:


librarian/openapi/librarian.v0.yaml

- Spec MUST match implemented behavior
- Schema objects must align with canonical Mongo model
- Explicit examples included

---

## Postman Integration (Required)

- Librarian agent MUST maintain a **Postman project file**
- Postman collection MUST be generated or updated from OpenAPI
- Collection must include:
- artifact retrieval
- task retrieval
- policy retrieval
- health endpoints

Postman file is treated as **derived artifact**, not authority.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenAPI spec validates successfully
2. Spec matches live API behavior
3. Postman collection is updated from spec
4. Engineers can exercise API entirely via Postman
5. Spec is versioned and archived

---

## Notes

The OpenAPI spec is the **human-readable face of the Canon**.
