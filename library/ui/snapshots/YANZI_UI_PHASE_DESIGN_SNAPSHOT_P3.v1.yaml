design_intent:
  summary: >
    Phase 3 establishes a desktop-native, execution-safe header and navigation
    model for Yanzi. The focus is on clarity of authority, workspace context,
    and domain navigation, without introducing visuals, refactors, or code.

zone_definitions:
  zone_1a:
    name: Application Toolbar
    role: App-level chrome and global command surface
    characteristics:
      - Navigation-free (no domains)
      - Stable across all workspaces and phases
      - Desktop-native behavior
    contents:
      - Command Palette (primary interaction)
      - Home entry point
      - Workspace selector (context selection only)
      - Notifications
      - Application / system settings
      - Profile and identity controls

  zone_1b:
    name: Workspace Toolbar
    role: Workspace context and execution truth
    visual_treatment:
      - Visually distinct from Zone 1.a
      - Subtle background differentiation
    information_order:
      - Workspace name
      - Execution state
      - Context selectors
    execution_state_model:
      style: icon-forward with supporting text
      properties:
        - Phase
        - State (design, execution, complete)
        - Mutability (mutable, read-only, canonical)
    interaction_rules:
      - Workspace name is clickable for workspace management
      - Execution state is informational only
      - Context selectors apply globally to the workspace

  zone_2a:
    name: Left Toolbar Rail
    role: Canonical domain navigation
    navigation_model:
      - Domain-primary
      - Fixed and system-defined
      - Icon + label always visible
    canonical_domains:
      - Home
      - Library
      - Projects
      - Workflows
      - Agents
      - Teams
    extension_policy:
      - Allows limited cross-domain lenses
      - Extensions must not alter execution state

non_goals:
  - No visual design or styling decisions
  - No code or implementation work
  - No execution or enforcement controls
  - No user customization of canonical navigation

governance_notes:
  - All decisions align with locked UI shell and zones
  - Design intent is captured prior to any visible UI changes
  - This snapshot serves as the authoritative reference for Phase 3 execution
