PASS (with follow-up actions)

## Basis

All retained concepts comply with:

- governance/laws/persistence-law.md
- guardian persistence preflight

Both the UI Agent report and the originating prompt are required to be persisted.

## Per-Concept Disposition

(Authoritative summary)

- Action Compass — PASS
- Procedure Ladder — PASS (follow-up required)
- Mission Rail — PASS (follow-up required)
- Instrumentation Grid — PASS
- Vitals Band — PASS
- Alert Flow — PASS
- Authority Matrix — PASS (follow-up required)

## Rejected Concepts

File explorer tree, editor tabs, SCM view, debugger panels, marketplace mechanics — correctly rejected under §11 and §3.

## Required Follow-Ups (Blocking for future expansion only)

1. Procedure Ladder: define guardrails for simultaneous parameter entry.
2. Mission Rail: define scaling/grouping rules beyond initial deck set.
3. Authority Matrix: define certification workflow and violation surfacing.

No further blocks once these are captured canonically.
