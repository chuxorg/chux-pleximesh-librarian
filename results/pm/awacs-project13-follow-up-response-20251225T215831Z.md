**Project Tasks**
- `Procedure Ladder Guardrails (Simultaneous Parameters)` — Owner: UI Agent (Procedure Ladder maintainer). Scope: codify sequential vs simultaneous guardrails, update the cockpit spec so simultaneous runs surface all parameters with inline validation, and log QA/telemetry acceptance notes; execution discipline covers dedicated branch from `dev`, dev → qa → master promotion, UI PR referencing Librarian artifacts, commit-after-each prompt cadence, and mandatory artifact persistence (see `chux-pleximesh-librarian/results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks-20251225T215831Z.md:3`).
- `Mission Rail Scaling & Grouping Rules` — Owner: UI Agent (Mission Rail owner). Scope: document deck grouping thresholds/metadata plus glanceable behaviors, acceptance criteria for clutter limits, and observability cues; execution rules mirror per-task branch off `dev`, dev → qa → master flow, UI PR requirement, commit-per-prompt, and persistence of specs + QA notes (see `chux-pleximesh-librarian/results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks-20251225T215831Z.md:16`).
- `Authority Matrix Certification Workflow` — Owner: Guardian Agent. Scope: define declaration + certification workflow, enforcement/audit expectations, and acceptance criteria for notifications; execution requires Guardian branch from `dev`, dev → qa → master progression, PRs for any UI contributions, commit-per-prompt, and persistence of workflow/enforcement/QA artifacts (see `chux-pleximesh-librarian/results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks-20251225T215831Z.md:29`).

**Persistence**
- `Prompt`: `chux-pleximesh-librarian/data/prompts/pm/20251225T215831Z_awacs-project13-follow-up_prompt.md:1`
- `Task definitions`: `chux-pleximesh-librarian/results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks-20251225T215831Z.md:3`
- `Final response`: `chux-pleximesh-librarian/results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-response-20251225T215831Z.md:1`

Next step: add these three entries to GitHub Project 13 referencing the Librarian paths above, assign the UI/Guardian owners, and enforce the branch/PR/persistence rules before any execution begins.
