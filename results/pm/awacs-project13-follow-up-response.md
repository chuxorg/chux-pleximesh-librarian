- Captured the three approved follow-ups as GitHub-ready tasks with scope, ownership, and SDLC controls in `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks.md:3`.
- Procedure Ladder guardrails stay with the UI Agent; scope covers sequential vs simultaneous criteria, inline validation, and Librarian-linked acceptance notes plus UI PR requirements per `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks.md:3`.
- Mission Rail scaling and grouping remains a UI Agent deliverable with explicit deck behaviors, clutter limits, and mandatory PR + persistence steps in `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks.md:16`.
- Authority Matrix certification workflow is now a Guardian-owned task defining certification + enforcement mechanics and branch discipline per `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks.md:29`.
- The original prompt is persisted verbatim at `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-prompt.md:1` for traceability.

Next steps:
1. Create the three Project 13 items referencing the Librarian artifact paths and assign the UI/Guardian owners.
2. Notify those owners to open their working branches from `dev`, follow PR/commit cadence, and start execution once tasks appear on the board.

Artifacts persisted:
- `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-prompt.md:1`
- `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-tasks.md:3`
- `results/pm/awacs-project13-follow-up-response.md:1`
