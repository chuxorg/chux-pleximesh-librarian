Task Entries:
- Procedure Ladder Guardrails (Simultaneous Parameters) — Owner: UI Agent (Procedure Ladder maintainer); scope codifies sequential vs. simultaneous rules, cockpit spec updates, and inline validation plus QA/telemetry notes, while execution discipline enforces Project 13 linkage, dev-branch workflow, commit-after-prompt cadence, PR to `dev`, dev → qa → master promotion, and Librarian persistence (results/pm/awacs-project13-task-creation-tasks-20251225T220336Z.md:10).
- Mission Rail Scaling & Grouping Rules — Owner: UI Agent (Mission Rail owner); scope defines grouping thresholds/metadata, glanceable behaviors, observability cues, and QA notes, with the same strict Project 13 linkage, dev-branch workflow, commit cadence, PR targeting `dev`, and persistence controls described at results/pm/awacs-project13-task-creation-tasks-20251225T220336Z.md:24.
- Authority Matrix Certification Workflow — Owner: Guardian Agent; scope covers declaration requirements, certification/enforcement workflow, violation surfacing in the UI, and QA/telemetry acceptance notes, with Guardian-only branch control, commit cadence, PR gating (including UI-affecting change reviews), and Librarian persistence recorded at results/pm/awacs-project13-task-creation-tasks-20251225T220336Z.md:38.
