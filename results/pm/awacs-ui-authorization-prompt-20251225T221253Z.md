# Context from my IDE setup:

## Open tabs:
- .env.local: .env.local

## My request for Codex:
You are operating as an AWACS Agent within the PlexiMesh system.

The runtime event bus is NOT yet active.
Until it exists, you MUST enforce persistence manually.

---

## MANDATORY PERSISTENCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. You SHALL forward the **exact prompt you received** to the Librarian.
2. You SHALL forward **all artifacts you generate** to the Librarian.
3. You SHALL forward your **final response** to the Librarian IN ADDITION to replying here.
4. If persistence cannot be completed, you SHALL halt and report failure.

If it is not in the Librarian, it does not exist.

---

## ROLE
You are acting as the **PM Agent** for AWACS.

Project:
- GitHub Project: https://github.com/orgs/chuxorg/projects/13
Repository:
- chux-pleximesh-awacs

All governing documents are already persisted. You must enforce them exactly as written.

---

## OBJECTIVE
Complete **all actions required** to authorize the UI Agent to begin execution on assigned tasks.

Do not invent scope. Do not relax discipline. Do not begin execution yourself.

---

## REQUIRED ACTIONS (IN ORDER)

### 1. Verify Project Tasks
Confirm the following tasks exist in **Project 13** and match scope exactly:

- Procedure Ladder Guardrails (Simultaneous Parameters)
- Mission Rail Scaling & Grouping Rules
- Authority Matrix Certification Workflow

If any task is missing or diverges from the persisted definitions, STOP and correct it.

---

### 2. Attach Librarian References
For EACH task:
- Add links to the persisted Librarian artifacts:
  - Task definitions document
  - Guardian PASS decision (if applicable)
- Ensure the task description explicitly states:
  - dev → qa → master promotion flow
  - Working branch from `dev`
  - Commit-after-each-prompt requirement
  - Mandatory PR for UI Agent work
  - Mandatory artifact persistence

No task may proceed without these references.

---

### 3. Assign Owners
Assign owners exactly as follows:

- Procedure Ladder Guardrails → UI Agent
- Mission Rail Scaling & Grouping Rules → UI Agent
- Authority Matrix Certification Workflow → Guardian Agent

Do NOT assign secondary owners unless explicitly required later.

---

### 4. Set Execution Preconditions
For the two UI Agent tasks, explicitly state in the task:

- Work may begin ONLY after:
  - Task is assigned
  - Librarian references are attached
  - Branching + PR rules are acknowledged

If acknowledgements are missing, execution is BLOCKED.

---

### 5. Notify the UI Agent
Notify the UI Agent that:

- Tasks are assigned and authorized
- Execution MUST:
  - Start from `dev`
  - Use one working branch per task
  - Commit after every prompt execution
  - Open a PR targeting `dev`
  - Persist all prompts, artifacts, and responses to the Librarian

Make it explicit that **no work outside tasks is permitted**.

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You MUST produce:
1. Confirmation that all three tasks exist and are correctly configured in Project 13
2. Confirmation of owner assignments
3. Confirmation that the UI Agent has been notified and authorized to begin

You MUST then:
- Persist this prompt to the Librarian
- Persist your confirmation output to the Librarian

Only after persistence is complete may the UI Agent begin work.
