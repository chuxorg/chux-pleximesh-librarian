# AWACS Project 13 — UI Agent Task Acknowledgement (2025-12-25)

## Procedure Ladder Guardrails (Simultaneous Parameters)
I will begin from `dev`, create a dedicated branch (e.g., `ui/procedure-ladder-guardrails`), commit after every prompt execution, push those commits immediately, and open a PR targeting `dev`. I will not merge my own PR, will stay strictly within this task’s scope, and will reference Librarian artifacts for every PR/task update. I will persist every artifact (prompt, intermediate response, final result) tied to this task before considering any step complete.

## Mission Rail Scaling & Grouping Rules
I will begin from `dev`, create a dedicated branch (e.g., `ui/mission-rail-scaling`), commit after every prompt execution, push those commits immediately, and open a PR targeting `dev`. I will not merge my own PR, will stay strictly within this task’s scope, and will reference Librarian artifacts for every PR/task update. I will persist every artifact (prompt, intermediate response, final result) tied to this task before considering any step complete.

## Global Commitment
No implementation work will begin until this acknowledgement is persisted in the Librarian. I will continue to persist all prompts, artifacts, and responses, and will obey dev → qa → master promotion with Guardian gating before any merges.
